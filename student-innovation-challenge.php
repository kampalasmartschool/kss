            Student Innovation Challenge is a Place and Community-Based Innovation Competition for students 
            of age groups <b>6 to 18 years</b>. This Competition provides opportunity for the students to connect 
            learning to their communities with the primary goals of increasing student engagement, boosting 
            academic outcomes, impacting communities and promoting understanding of the world around them.
            <br/>
What better way to prepare students for their future than by teaching them to think systematically about problematic 
situations in their communities, gathering information to understand the situation, and to evaluate multiple solutions
 in order to best address the situation?
<br/>
This competition encourages creativity and rewards students for the solutions they identify.
 It rewards the students who submit the most creative, thought-provoking, and innovative ideas and Kampala
  Smart School will mobilise support to putting their ideas into action.
