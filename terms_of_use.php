We will do so only with written authorization from the educational institution that acknowledges that we are providing that information as an educational institution’s agent, and that once the information is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the information.  If a written request to disclose the Personal Information of students to a third party is provided to us, the educational institution releases us from all responsibility over the use or disposition of such information.
