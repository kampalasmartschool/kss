				This Privacy Policy explains how 
				information is collected, used, and disclosed by Kampala Smart School (“Kampala Smart School,” 
				“we,” “us,” or “our”) in connection with your use of our websites, online services, desktop 
				applications and mobile applications that link to this Privacy Policy (each a “Service”; 
				collectively, “Services”).  Each time you use any Service, you consent to our collection, 
				use, and/or disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.  
				Each time you allow others to use any Service via your account, you confirm that 
				you have the right to consent on their behalf to our collection, use and disclosure 
				of their information as described in detail below.  Accordingly, we urge you to read 
				this Privacy Policy in full, as well as our Terms of Service, and contact us if you 
				have any questions.
			</p>

			<p>
				We market and sell our products to adults who purchase or otherwise subscribe to our Services, 
				which can then be used by children at the direction and under the supervision of these adults.  
				We respect all of our users’ privacy, but we recognize the need to provide additional privacy 
				protections with respect to the personal information we collect from children under 18 pursuant 
				to the Government of Uganda Computer Misuse Act of 2011.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				Accordingly, our privacy practices with respect to children under 18 are set forth below in our
				Children’s Privacy Policy section.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>
				<b>A special note to children:</b>  If you are under 18, please get permission from your parent or 
				legal guardian before using our Services.  You must be 18 or older to purchase or otherwise 
				subscribe to any Service.  We do not market or sell to children under 18, and we seek consent 
				from a parent or legal guardian whenever we identify that a minor attempts to purchase or 
				register for a subscription to any Service. 
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				<b>A special note to parents: </b>  Please help us protect your children’s privacy by instructing them
				never to volunteer their personal information online without your permission.
