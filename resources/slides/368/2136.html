<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px">Besides, the general report indicated that Social Studies was the best done subject. However, she also noted that Mathematics was the worst done subject. The minister congratulated all the candidates on their success. She also thanked the teachers and head teachers who had taught the candidates and conducted examinations without any <u>malpractice</u>.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px">Since urban schools performed better than rural school, the minister warned teachers in rural areas against absenteeism, late coming and high rate of school d<u>ropout</u> in rural schools.
