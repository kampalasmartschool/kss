<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">A boy named John was once taking care of some sheep not far from a forest. Nearby was a village, and he was told to call for help if there was any danger.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out with all his might, &quot;The wolf is coming!</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">The wolf is coming!&quot; The men came running with clubs and axes to save the boy from the wolf. As they saw nothing, they went home again and left John laughing in his sleeve.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">Because he had had so much fun, John cried out again the next day, &quot;The wolf!&nbsp; The wolf!&quot; The men came again, but not as many as the first time. Again they saw no trace of the wolf, so they shook their heads and went back.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in dismay, &quot;Help!&nbsp; Help! The wolf! The wolf!&quot; But not a single man came to help him. The wolf broke into the flock and killed a great many sheep. Among them was a beautiful lamb that belonged to John. Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends and neighbors, and he grieved over the loss of his pet lamb.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:22px">The truth itself is not believed, from one who often has deceived.</span></span></p>
