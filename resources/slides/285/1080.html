<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Christian drove to Lake Tahoe to take pictures of the lake, trees and mountains for her photography class. She woke up early and left the house at 4:00 am while it was still dark outside. She stopped at a small restaurant for breakfast and ten continued driving. When she arrived at Lake Tahoe, the sky was pink and the sun was rising over the water. She sat on a rock next to the lake and watched the fish swim in water and listened to the beautiful bird chirp.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">She thought about how lucky she was to be in such a beautiful, peaceful place. Then she hurried to her car to get her camera so she could take pictures for her class project.</span></span></p>
