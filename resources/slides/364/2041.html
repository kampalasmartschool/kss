<p><span style="color:#0000ff"><span style="font-size:22px">Read the passage and answer questions about it correctly.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px">NATIONALITIES</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">It is very interesting to meet people of different nationalities. This can be either at a party or at school. Nationality refers to the legal right of belonging to a particular nation or country. Sometimes, a person may have dual nationality. Dual nationality means a citizen of two countries.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">In our school, we always meet people of different nationalities. For example, we meet the Sudanese, Indians, Congolese, Kenyans, Rwandese, and Tanzanians. Each of these pupils speak a different language.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Students from Congo speak Lingala whereas those from Rwanda speak Kinyarwanda and French. The speak French because it is believed that they were once colonized by France.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Kenyan and Tanzanian students usually speak Kiswahili whereas Ugandan nationals speak a variety of local languages such as Luganda, Runyakitara, Luo, Lumasaba, Lusoga, among others. Despite these many languages, at school, teachers always encourage students or pupils to speak or use English as a medium of communication. This is, however, done to promote unity and cooperation among pupils of different nationalities.</span></p>
