We learnt and rehearsed poems, dances and plays. A few days before the final concert, we had a dress rehearsal. This is when performances were done exactly as they will be done on the big day.</span></span></span></p>

Official called adjudicators arrived from the district. There were four houses in the competition. Each house recited a poem and performed traditional dance, a folk song and acted a play. Everybody did their best. At the end of the day, the adjudicators announced the results. They gave out three trophies to the best house for reciting a poem, a dance and acting the best play. We all enjoyed the festival.</span></span></span></p>
