<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">In Mirembe village, people love peace and security. Their Local Council 1 Chairperson, Mr. Baba usually encourages them to work together as a community to maintain peace and security at all time.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">In order to achieve their goals, the chairman organizes peace and security meeting every last Sunday of the month. During the meetings, the citizens suggested and passed resolutions on various ways of promoting peace and security in their village. On some occasions, the chairman invites the District Police Commander (DPC) to educate the citizens on the dangers of insecurity and mob justice.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">At the entrance to the LC1 Chairman&rsquo;s office, there is the village motto &ldquo;Together we can achieve peace and security in Mirembe Village&rdquo;. This motto has helped the citizens to reduce the rate of <u>offences</u> such as defilement, rape, theft, mob justice, witch craft, etc.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">The offences have been reduced through networking, for instance all visitors in this village are always introduced to the LC1 office. In addition, the landlords and landladies usually report new tenants to the LC1 office as well. This is done to avoid living with criminals or wrong doers in Mirembe village.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">One day, a young man called Okarche was found trying to steal the neighbour&rsquo;s goat. The owner of the goat saw him and made an alarm which assembled the citizens. They wanted to set him on fire but luckily the chairman arrived and called the 999 police patrol. Later on, Okarche was taken to the Police station to make a statement. The O.C station warned him of the dangers of stealing. Okarche promised to change.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">When the police <u>set him free</u>, Okarche completely changed his behavior. He learnt to work hard and live in peace and security. He started making bricks and rearing poultry. Besides, the NAADS programme officer of Kween sub-county headquarters gave Okarche a heifer. Okarche is now a very hardworking and law abiding citizen.</span></span></span></p>
