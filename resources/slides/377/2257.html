<p><span style="color:#0000cd"><span style="font-size:22px">Read the passage below and answer questions about it in full sentences.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">Carpentry is one of the most self reliant or independent occupations in our country today. It involves making and repairing wooden objects. Carpentry requires life skills. Besides, one has to join a technical institution in order to acquire professional skills in wood work and joinery.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">In Uganda, like in other parts of the world, there are a number of technical institutes. Some are private and others are owned by the government. These include; Elgon Technical Institute in the Eastern region, Kichwamba Technical Institute in the Western region, Kisubi and Kyambogo Technical Institutes, Uganda Technical Institute in Lira in Northern region among others.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">These institutes have trained many carpenters in Uganda. The carpenters make good office and home furniture. Some furniture are even exported to neighbouring countries South Sudan, Kenya and Rwanda. The carpenters however say that the best wood come from Ssesse Islands. Mahogany, Oak, Mvule are some of the trees that provide hard wood. On the other hand, cypress and pine provide soft wood.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">First, the lumberjacks <u>fell</u> the trees into logs with power saws. Next, the logs are sawed into timber which is soon or later transported and distributed to different parts of the country for sale. Then, the carpenters access and <u>purchase</u> the timber in any quantities they can afford from the timber stores. They make it smooth with planes; cut the planks into sizable pieces and make beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, and coffins for the dead. Tools such as hammers, drills, saw, screw drivers, nails and glue are used to join and fix furniture firmly.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">After making the furniture, the carpenters polish it with vanish and brushes. Vanish makes furniture shiny and glittering.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#000000">Finally, the carpenters display their work either in the showrooms or by road side for customers to admire and buy. In turn, they make a lot of money and send their children to school.</span></span></p>
