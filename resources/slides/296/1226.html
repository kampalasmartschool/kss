<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px">A VISIT TO MR. BABA&rsquo;S GARAGE</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Baba is a skilled mechanic. He has a big garage at Wandageya along Kampala-Bombo Road. His garage is always busy because he receives many vehicles which have broken down daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Last term, the primary five pupils of KinderKare Elementary School visited Mr. Baba&rsquo;s garage. Their main aim was to learn about the equipment used in vehicle repair. When they arrived at Mr. Baba&rsquo;s garage, the mechanic and other workers welcomed them and showed them the equipment used in vehicle repair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">First, the pupils saw a tool box. The mechanic told them that he keeps his tools such as spanners, screw drivers, pliers, files, testers etc in it. Next, he opened the tool box and the pupils saw the tools with their eyes and were even allowed to touch and feel. The pupils asked him some questions and answered them politely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">After that, the mechanic showed them a car jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s is a machine or device used to hold vehicles while removing flat tyres or changing wheels,&rdquo; Said Mr. Baba.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Further more, the mechanic showed the pupils how the engine oil is changed. He also <u>demonstrated</u> to the pupils by greasing a few parts of a vehicle. He added that a vehicle needs regular service like a human being needs a regular medical check up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">The pupils were so happy that they thanked and clapped for him for teaching and allowing them to visit his garage.</span></p>
