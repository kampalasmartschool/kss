<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#0000ff"><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">The trader</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">In Perryvillie village, there lived a trader called Baba. He was a very hard working man. His wife and children were hard working too.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Baba had a big shop. He sold building materials like cement, nails and paint. He could go up to Kwania to buy them for his shop. He sold them at a cheaper price compared to other traders. People were very happy with him. Many of them built houses because of Baba&rsquo;s good prices.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Baba did not just stop at trading in building materials. At home, he reared animals and grew different crops. People in that sub-county were happy with Baba because he employed many of them on his farm. He paid them very well.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Baba could share ideas with people who wanted to work and be like him. People started working hard by putting up other businesses like the carpentry shops and others went to tailoring. They lived happily together in their sub county. Bravo Baba!</span></span></p>
