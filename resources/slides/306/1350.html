<p><span style="font-size:22px">A compound adjective is sometimes called a hyphenated adjective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">A compound adjective is an adjective that contains two or more words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">In general we put a hyphen between two or more words (before a noun) when we want them to act as a single idea (adjective) that describes something.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">I live in an English-speaking country.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">English-speaking is an adjective (used to describe the country). We use a hyphen to connect the word <em>English</em> with <em>speaking</em> to show that it is one adjective (or one idea).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">This adjective with two words joined by the hyphen is called a compound adjective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Some more examples of compound adjectives are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">Our office is in a twenty-storey building.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">I have just finished reading a 300-page book.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">He is a well-known writer.</span></li>
</ul>
