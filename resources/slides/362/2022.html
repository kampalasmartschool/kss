<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px">Read the passage below and answer questions about it correctly.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">There are many telephone companies operating in Uganda today. These telephone companies, however, have different names and slogans. Some of the names are Uganda Telecom with the slogan &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about U&rdquo;, MTN with &ldquo;Everywhere you go&rdquo;, Africell with &ldquo;Today changes with Africell&rdquo;. Uganda Telecom is believed to be the oldest of all of them.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Airtel was first known as Celtel. Then later on, it was renamed as Zain but today it is called Airtel. Each company has both landlines and mobile phones. All these companies are licensed by Uganda Communication Commission.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">However, o be able to access their services, a customer is given a subscriber&rsquo;s identification module (SIM) card. Besides, the subscriber loads airtime in order to make a call or send and SMS to any given network. To boost their network, each telephone company built network masts or towers with aerials that send and receive signals all over the country.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">In fact, telephone companies do not only make communication easy but also provide employment to many Ugandans in different sectors. For instance, some people work at the customer care centres, others drive company vehicles and many sell airtime and SIM cards. This enables them to earn a living and even send their children to schools.</span></p>
