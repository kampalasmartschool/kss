<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">In the order of adjectives, the adjectives have to come before the noun they are describing while in relative pronoun and &ldquo;and&rsquo; the adjectives come after the nouns they are describing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">In the order of adjectives, the number or quantity adjective comes first while in relative pronoun and &ldquo;and&rdquo; the number of quantity adjective comes before the noun it is describing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">In &ldquo;relative pronoun&rdquo; and &ldquo;and&rdquo; when the answer has poor ending (incomplete) you create your own ending to have complete meaning.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:22px">In use of &lsquo;relative pronoun&rdquo; and &ldquo;ad&rdquo; we separate the adjectives with commas while in the order of adjective we don&rsquo;t put commas.&nbsp; This is because the commas are used only when the last two adjectives are separated with &ldquo; and&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></li>
