<p><span style="font-size:22px">The biggest airport in Uganda is Entebbe International Airport. It is <u>situated</u> in Wakiso District at the shores of Lake Victoria, about 30 kilometers from the capital city, Kampala. The airport is surrounded by a large mass of water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Everyday, a good number of planes, big and small land and take off at Entebbe Airport. At the airport, there are runways. A runway is a long narrow strip of ground with a hard tarmacked surface that an aircraft or plane takes off from and lands on. The runways are about four kilometers long and about sixty metres wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">The planes which are <u>taking off</u> or landing are controlled from the control tower. A control tower is a building at an airport from which the movement of aircrafts are controlled. In the control tower sits air traffic controllers in charge of all the planes. The control tower has a radio connection or link with the planes and pilots. They keep on giving them instruction or information about safety, security, weather conditions or when and where to land or take off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Apart from pilots and air traffic controllers, there are many other workers at the airport. These include causal labourers, drivers, security personnel, hostesses and engineers. The engineers are responsible for the safety of the aircraft and passengers. The hostesses help the passengers majorly with information about flight and feeding.</span></p>
