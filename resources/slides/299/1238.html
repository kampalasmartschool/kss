<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, Madam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, you boy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the booking office?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is. How can I help you young boy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to book a train to Kisumu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; Which class of train would you like to book?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First class please, Madam. How much is the fare?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; First class train to Kisumu is thirty five thousand five hundred shillings only.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the money. Please, organize my ticket. At what time does the train depart for Kisumu?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; The train to Kisumu departs from Kampala Railway Station at 11:00 am. You have less than an hour to eat some &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; snacks. Here is your ticket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#0000cd">Taj</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much, Madam. I am looking forward to travelling by train now. I hope I will have an exciting journey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Clerk:&nbsp;&nbsp; of course you will. It is always very interesting to travel by train. I am sure you will be excited to see the coaches of the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;train coiling on the railway line like a millipede.</span></p>
