<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px">The little donkey ran and ran until he came to a large forest, where he felt sure that his cruel master and mistress could not find him. There was a lovely stream among the tree, and soft grass grew near it, so he had plenty to eat and drink.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:22px">Days passed and he grew fatter and stronger and enjoyed himself very much. But afterwards, the weather began to turn cold. He decided to find some warm place before the winter came on. He trotted on and on through the forest until he found his way out at the other side. There, he saw a narrow road which led to the village. He walked slowly along the road until he came to a small white cottage, standing all by itself in a pretty flowery garden. He saw an old woman. She sat knitting in a rocking chair, he back to the garden gate. Very softly, the little donkey pushed open the gate and trotting up to the old woman, laid his head on her shoulder.</span></span></p>
