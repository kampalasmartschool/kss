<p><span style="color:#0000cd"><span style="font-size:22px">Read the passage below and answer questions that follow in full sentences.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">At the beginning of second term, the Primary Five pupils of KinderKare Elementary School were taught about post office. Their teacher of English Ms. Gloria Nantale taught them the services that the post office provides to the general public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">In order to teach her lesson successfully, Ms. Nantale carried with her teaching-learning aids like stamps, envelopes, samples of telegrams, parcels, a letter box and a telephone directory.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">As soon as she started the lesson, one of her pupils called Lucy asked her how to find her mother&rsquo;s telephone number from the directory</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Ms. Nantale tactically answered Stella&rsquo;s question. She said that the names in the directory are usually organized in alphabetical order. &ldquo;You should learn the alphabet first,&rdquo; said Ms. Nantale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">&nbsp;Shortly after that, another pupil called Karma why it is advisable to seal letters in an envelope and then put stamps. &ldquo;That is a very good question, Karma&rdquo; said Ms. Nantale. First of all, when a letter is sealed in an envelope, the message is confidential and safe. Secondly, the money obtained from selling the stamps is used for postage charges and paying salaries of the post office staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">The lesson was so interesting that the pupils requested teacher to arrange a visit to the post office in order to learn more about postal services.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">The following day, Ms. Nantale organized and took the pupils to a nearby post office in the neighbouring trading centre. While at the post office, the post master and mistress explained to the pupils the use of mail box, the directory and telefax services. They also showed them different postal equipment and a telephone directory.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">By the end of the visit, the pupils had acquired a lot of knowledge and skills. They left the post office excited and yearning to <u>narrate</u> stories to their parents about all what they had seen there.</span></p>
