<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px">AN INTERNET CAF&Eacute;</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">An internet caf&eacute; is a place with computers connected to the internet which people can use to surf. Nowadays, very many youths, organizations and companies are fond of surfing at the internet caf&eacute;. This is, however, possible because there are many service providers.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">In the past years, internet cafes were scarce and therefore Ugandan citizens didn&rsquo;t have access to the internet. There was also poor storage of <u>data</u>. The internet is an international computer network connecting other networks and computers from other companies, universities or organizations through an internet service provider.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">An internet service provider provides you with an internet connection and services such as emails, surfing and logging. In order for one to log in or on, one needs a password. The password allows ne to begin using a computer system. At the internet caf&eacute;, one can have access to the internet explorer. This is a computer program connected to the internet used for searching for information.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Besides, one gets access to the search engine. A search engine is a computer program that searches the internet for information, for example by looking for documents containing a particular word or group of words. In order to access information, all one needs is Google. Google means to type words into a search engine on the internet in order to find information about something or somebody. For example, job opportunities, educational, political, health or commercial issues. This service is used as a form of communication. It also enables individuals, organizations, companies and the government to send and <em><u>essential</u></em> messages and information all over the world within a short period of time. Furthermore, it reduces the costs and time that might have been spent for one to pay for air tickets to travel to different parts of the world <u>in search of</u> information.</span></p>
