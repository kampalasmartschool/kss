<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#daa520">Lucy:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, did she look right, look left and right again before crossing the road?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Amara:<strong><em> </em></strong>Not at all! She was in a hurry. She was afraid of being late for the first English lesson.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#daa520">Lucy:&nbsp;</span><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong>Oh my God! That was a big mistake!
