<p><span style="font-size:22px">Going for school holidays.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">There are three terms in a year. At the end of every term, school children break off for holidays. School holidays are the happiest and funniest moments in school life. School holidays give children time to relax, plan and visit their relatives and friends in urban and rural areas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Of the three holidays, third term&rsquo;s holidays is the longest. This is because it lasts for two months or sixty days. The first and second term&rsquo;s holidays last for about three to four weeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">During holidays, children get chance to help their parents on the farm with garden work or with house chores at home. Holidays also provide children with ample time to learn new skills such as knitting, weaving, modeling, baking and looking after domestic animals. They also enable children to <u>prepare</u> for the next term.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Sometimes, children tour places of their interests such as game parks, zoos, museums, historical sites, mountains and forests. In addition, children go camping with their peers. On some occasions, religious leaders organize retreats for the youths during holidays. This gives the youths a platform to meet people from all walks of life and share ideas and acquire new knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px">Dear children, it is good to plan for your holidays. Never waste your holidays gossiping or gambling. Remember to use every time that you get during holidays profitably.</span></p>
