<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Taj&rsquo;s mother had a shop in Mingaladon market, where she sold slippers. Taj helped his mother in the shop during school holidays. As the Mingaladon market was an army market, soldiers could be seen shopping there daily. It was more crowded on Sundays. Many soldiers could be seen moving about busily.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">It was Sunday and Taj was sitting in front of the shop; &ldquo;Young brother, do you have a real &lsquo;Sin-Kye&rsquo; No. 9?&rdquo; A young man wearing trousers entered and asked him. Quickly Taj took a pair of &lsquo;sin-kye No. 9 slippers and showed them. &ldquo;How much are these slippers brother&rdquo; Ten thousand shillings, elder brother&rdquo;. &ldquo;Can I take only the right side slipper and pay you five thousand shillings?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">The young man made Taj&rsquo;s eyes become wide. If he sold only the right side, how could he sell the left side? And why did he want only one slipper?&rdquo; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that. If I sell only the right side, the left side in the shop will be useless. Yes, but I want only the right side. But wait, I&rsquo;ll go and look for a partner. Taj was left behind, looking at the back of the young man, who walked away limping.</span></span></p>
